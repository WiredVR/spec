# WiredVR (name subject to change) Specification

## Motivation

The "Metaverse" VR space is in a nascent state. The largest social VR applications in the market today, such as VRChat, Neos, ChilloutVR, and Horizon Worlds are closed source walled gardens that have no standardized specification. The Wired aims to bring the success of the world wide web to metaverses, prioritizing giving developers the most robust and simple development experience possible, and encouraging multiple implementations of the specification to be made.

Just as web apps have replaced the need for downloading desktop apps in many cases with the advancement of web technology, the aim of Wired is to provide a platform where users can explore virtual reality content effortlessly, and give developers the tools needed to fulfill their ideas to their hearts desires.

## Design Goals

The Wired has the following design goals:

- Backwards compatibility **forever**. Any content built upon the stable specification of The Wired should always work.
- Ease of development. Development for the Wired should be a breeze, with minimal limitations in terms of engine capabilities.
- Maximized reliance on previously established standards.
